  default_prompt: "Use $journal-alert-to-notion to process a Gmail journal alert using the exact email subject and received timestamp (or use date-only mode if I only provide a date), extract only safe candidate links (never unsubscribe/manage-alert URLs), inspect Gmail helper diagnostics (`ui_probe`, `list_hydration`, `attempts`) if Gmail shows zero rows or search behaves inconsistently, precheck canonical DOI duplicates against my target Notion database before expensive verification when possible, verify research articles/editorials on official publisher pages (including anti-bot protected pages), and add only verified non-duplicate entries. Report added items, skipped items with reasons, duplicate hits, and any verification gaps."
